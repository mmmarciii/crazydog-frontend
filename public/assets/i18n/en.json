  "FAQ": {
    "TITLE": "FAQ",
    "SUBTITLE": "Common questions about custom orders",
    "Q1": "How long does it take to make a pair of shoes?",
    "A1": "The production time depends on several factors: our current capacity, the availability of the selected base shoe, and the complexity of the design. In general, the design process takes 3–5 business days, followed by approximately 10–15 business days for production. This timeframe may vary depending on the season. The exact turnaround time is always confirmed when the order is finalized.",
    "Q2": "Does the listed price include the cost of the shoes?",
    "A2": "No, it does not.",
    "Q3": "Can used shoes be painted?",
    "A3": "Yes, but only clean shoes in like-new or lightly used condition. Each case requires individual approval. We do not accept heavily worn or old shoes, as they cannot guarantee the desired quality. These rules ensure that every Crazy Dog Custom design remains durable and aesthetically pleasing. If you want to use used shoes or shoes made of special materials, please contact us before placing your order.",
    "Q4": "How water-resistant and durable are the shoes?",
    "A4": "Crazy Dog Custom shoes are created using paints and materials specifically developed for footwear to ensure maximum durability. Each pair receives multiple layers of waterproof protective coating and impregnation, helping protect the design from moisture and everyday wear.",
    "Q5": "Can the shoes be washed or cleaned?",
    "A5": "Yes, you can gently clean the shoes using a soft, damp cloth. Avoid harsh cleaning agents, scrubbing, or washing machines, as these may damage the paint, protective layers, and the shoe material.",
    "Q6": "How can I extend the lifespan of my custom shoes?",
    "A6": "To protect the paint and surface, we recommend reapplying a waterproofing spray about every 3 months after cleaning. You can use a standard water-repellent shoe spray available in shoe stores. This helps preserve the quality of the artwork and extend the life of the custom design. This way, your Crazy Dog Custom shoes will retain their original appearance for a long time.",
    "Q7": "What happens if I want to modify the design?",
    "A7": "Based on the information you provide and after the one-time design fee is paid, you will receive the design of your dream shoes. Minor changes are possible at this stage, and we are flexible about them. However, altering an already completed design or adding a new concept will incur additional costs, which will be communicated in advance. Important: Once a design is approved and the order is placed, it is final and cannot be changed.",
    "Q8": "What happens if I provide the wrong shoe size?",
    "A8": "Please double-check your size carefully, as we cannot offer refunds or exchanges due to sizing issues.",
    "Q9": "When and how do I have to pay?",
    "A9": "Payment is made in two stages:",
    "A9_1": "After initial contact and sending your ideas, but before the design phase: payment of a one-time design fee by bank transfer.",
    "A9_2": "After the design is completed and approved by you, but before production begins: payment of the shoe price, shipping cost, and production fee by bank transfer.",
    "Q10": "What shipping options are available?",
    "A10": "All finished shoes are delivered by courier service to the address you provide.",
    "Q11": "Is international shipping available?",
    "A11": "Yes.",
    "Q12": "Can I return or exchange the shoes?",
    "A12": "Due to the custom-made and personalized nature of our products, we do not offer refunds, exchanges, or warranties (except for defects caused by material faults of the shoe itself)."
